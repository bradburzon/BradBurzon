# Personal Project
I want to use this repository to host my domain. 

## Planning
The website will be fairly simple. It will have three pages including Home, Resume, and About.

### Resume
A downloadable pdf will be in this page.

### About

## Design

For the colors, I picked silver, white, and a color close to teal. I like MacBook and the silver color so it will be my primary color. The green will be my font/icons color to add some life and white will be the background just to make it simple.
