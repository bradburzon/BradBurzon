# about me
### hi my name is brad.
I studied computer science for the last 4 years and have nothing major to show for it so here it is. I want to use the skills I have learned and put it to use as well share what I have learned, what mistakes I did, and what are my current projects.

**I am now __self-studying__ to be a software developer and I want to use this blog to post topics and ideas that I have studied and, hopefully, projects that I have completed.** I've learned a lot in 3 years and so I want to revisit those and put my knowledge here like a digital footprint. Although, that may take a very long time.

 I study mostly with Java, [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/), and web development. So most of my blog posts will be related to these.

### why a blog?
Because it is interesting. My first project in computer science is my own homepage where I uploaded all my homework. I remember being happy just seeing something that I created online and be able to share to friends and family. (I am not looking for fame by any means, but I still think it is interesting to make a blog even if may be the only reader)

### how did I make this blog?
I am using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator, along with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. After checking domains, I discovered it could hosted on [GitHub here](https://github.com/bradburzon/BradBurzon). At first, I was going to code everything from scratch including the styles and design. But I learned from my brother about Jekyll and it is perfect. I am free to customized the design with bootstrap and also forces me to use GitHub.
I am using Disqus to handle the comments. This wouldn't be a blog without enabling comments. However, there were more options to pick but Disqus is more money friendly since it is free.
