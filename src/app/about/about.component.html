      <div class="about-me mb-5">
        <h2>👋 Greetings!</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm Brad Burzon, a spirited software engineer freshly graduated
          from Purdue University Fort Wayne with a Bachelor's in Computer
          Science. My academic voyage was an exhilarating mix of coding
          marathons, project deadlines, and those brilliant "aha!" moments when
          all the pieces of a puzzle fit perfectly together.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>🛠️ Tech Toolkit:</h3>
        <p>
          My tech arsenal is diverse, spanning across languages like Java,
          JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and more. I'm proficient in front-end
          technologies including Angular and Bootstrap, and back-end solutions
          such as Node.js and Firebase. Not to mention, my expertise in testing
          and debugging, agile methodologies, and a plethora of tools and
          technologies from Docker to Figma.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>🌟 Project Spotlight: Order Flow</h3>
        <p>
          Venturing into the role of a Full-Stack Developer, I collaborated with
          a local restaurant to enhance their order management system using
          Angular and Firebase. This project not only boosted order efficiency
          by 20% but also processed over 5,000 orders, showcasing the power of
          real-time data processing and user-friendly design.
        </p>
