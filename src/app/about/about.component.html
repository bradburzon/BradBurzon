        <h2>üëã Greetings!</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm <strong>Brad Burzon</strong>, a spirited software engineer
          freshly graduated from Purdue University Fort Wayne with a Bachelor's
          in Computer Science. My academic voyage was an exhilarating mix of
          coding marathons, project deadlines, and those brilliant "aha!"
          moments when all the pieces of a puzzle fit perfectly together.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>üõ†Ô∏è Tech Toolkit:</h3>
        <p>
          My tech arsenal is diverse, spanning across languages like
          <strong>Java, JavaScript, TypeScript</strong>, and more. I'm
          proficient in front-end technologies including
          <strong>Angular and Bootstrap</strong>, and back-end solutions such as
          <strong>Node.js, MongoDB, and Firebase</strong>. Not to mention, my
          expertise in testing and debugging, agile methodologies, and a
          plethora of tools and technologies from
          <strong>Docker to Figma</strong>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>üåü Project Spotlight: <strong>Order Flow</strong></h3>
        <p>
          Venturing into the role of a <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong>, I
          collaborated with a local restaurant to enhance their order management
          system using Angular and Firebase. This project not only boosted order
          efficiency by 80% (from 50 seconds to 10 seconds) but also accurately
          processed over 10,000 orders and counting, showcasing the power of
          real-time data processing and user-friendly design.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>üí° What's really important to me?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> I'm always ready to dive deep
            into new technologies and methodologies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Team Collaboration:</strong> Collaborating with diverse
            teams and embracing constructive criticism fuels my passion for
            excellence.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>People Satisfaction:</strong> Ensuring satisfaction in the
            teams and individuals I work with is a priority.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Delivering Results:</strong> I live to transform ideas into
            tangible solutions that simplify life.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Impactful Work:</strong> Engaging in projects that have a
            meaningful and positive impact on society drives me.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Work-Life Balance:</strong> I believe in the synergy of
            professional achievements and personal well-being.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          From my days as a Computer Science Teaching Assistant to developing
          impactful projects like <strong>Order Flow</strong> and
          <strong>2DoList</strong>, I've always been driven by the desire to
          create and innovate. With each line of code, I aim to make a
          meaningful impact on people's lives and am eager to embark on my next
          adventure in the tech world.
