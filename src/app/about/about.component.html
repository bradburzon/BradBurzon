          coding marathons, project deadlines, and those brilliant "aha!"
          moments when all the pieces of a puzzle fit perfectly together.

        <h3>üåü Project Spotlight: <strong>Order Flow</strong></h3>
        <p>
          Venturing into the role of a <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong>, I
          collaborated with a local restaurant to enhance order management
          system leveraging Angular frontend and Firebase for storage and deployment. This project not only boosted
          order
          efficiency by 80% (from 50 seconds to 10 seconds) but also accurately
          processed over 10,000+ orders, showcasing the power of
          real-time data processing and user-friendly design.
